# FriendFinder
An app meant to utilize the concept of a dating app. It uses a local database (JSON file) to store the information of people who have already filled out the survey. The point is to get a user to complete a survey and find someone who has/had similar results within the database. The survey is going to require the user to fill out all of the questions before pushing the submit button. One thing that I will make sure the program does, is show the user that they actually submitted something by rerouting them to another page.

## Packages Used:
NPM:
    Express JS Library
    Path NPM Library
    HTML NPM Library

#### To Accomplish:
1. Create the server.js file on a valid port (y)
2. Install express and path to link the html files to a specific link (y)
3. Provide the code necessary for user-friendly interaction (y)
4. Allow the user to complete the questionaire with a submit button (y)
5. Write jquery to actually log the information and have the information logged within the json file
6. Take the data given, and compare it to the information within the json file for an actual match
7. Create another html that presents the user's submission with the best-suited match
8. BONUS: Figure why the fuck the css isn't working. This is bullshit!
